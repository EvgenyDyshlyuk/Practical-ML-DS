    "Through experience, humans learn to act intelligently - to acquire and apply knowledge. We are all able to learn to accomplish tasks for ourselves, some tasks with explicit guidance, and others without. For a human, a simple task is to be able to distinguish images of cats and dogs. A more complicated task would be to win a chess game. Both of these tasks require us to act intelligently and make decisions. Machine Learning is the field which focuses on getting machines to accomplish goals or tasks for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the problem of accomplishing goals can be framed as trying to produce some intended output given an input. As such, machine learning is all about automatically learning to represent the relationships between inputs and outputs. These inputs and outputs can take many forms as illustrated below.\n",
