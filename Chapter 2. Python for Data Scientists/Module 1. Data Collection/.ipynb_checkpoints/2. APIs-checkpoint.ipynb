    "\n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "- Learn what a REST API is\n",
    "- Use REST APIs to obtain data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we looked at scraping the web to obtain some (housing) data. In many cases, especially when wanting textual data, we may need to resort to scraping the web. However, some websites offer web APIs we may access to pull information from. Information coming from APIs are returned in a structured format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word API keeps popping... but what is it? And what is a REST API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API** stands for Application Programmable Interface. When we are writing a program/code, we would often need to interface with other people's code (e.g. a library). An API defines the rules we need to follow to talk to the code (e.g. function names).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **REST API** allows communication over HTTP. The client sends a request, and the server receives a response. Requests will take on one four following types: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. Most related to pulling data from other services (via APIs) is **GET**. As the name implies, this is HTTP Method we use when we want to request some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So how do we request data?**\n",
    "Well, we need a place to request data from, and this comes in the form of an endpoint URL. An endpoint URL usually looks something along these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/api_url_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visit the github API endpoint to see what the **response** is: https://api.github.com/users/ai-core/repos?sort=pushed&direction=desc\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the response from calling the Github API is a JSON object. However, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case - the developer who coded the API could have allowed for any file format to be returned (XML, CSV, Images etc.). For gathering data through APIs, JSON is typically the easiest to work with, so where possible, we should favour this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use the Zoopla API to gather the same information as we did in the web scraping lecture.\n",
    "\n",

       "   'description': \"Considered to be the archetypal London mansion, this exceptional property sits in the heart of Mayfair, just moments from both Park Lane and Grosvenor Square. The elegant stone-dressed, red-brick, five-storey home is arguably the best house on a prestigious street with a double-fronted Edwardian facade and Arts and Crafts style detailing. Having such a wide house in central London is extremely desired especially with a front facade of 18 windows. With exceptional curb appeal the house boasts a prominent Portland Stone doorway and French-inspired fine iron railings giving it a sense of grandeur upon arrival. Measuring in total 8513 sq ft, the sensitive modernisation of the six-bedroom townhouse included the creation of a wellness suite on the lower ground floor, complete with swimming pool, bar, sauna and relaxation zone, around a central light-filled glazed courtyard with ceiling heights of in excess of 7 metres. This unique property offers a rare amount of outside space, especially for any house in Mayfair, with three areas of outside space; the roof of the house has an undemised roof terrace with rooftop views stretching into the distance, a constant reminder of its beautiful and architecturally significant surroundings, the second floor-master bedroom suite leads onto another terrace and the principal reception rooms access a large south facing terrace which is perfect for al fresco entertaining. The prominent stately high-ceiling entrance hall, with polished diamond limestone flag stones, is large enough to comfortably house a huge stone fireplace. It leads to the study on the left and ahead is a large dining room with a secondary staircase and kitchen at the rear benefitting from a dumb waiter to also service the lower ground. There are three principal bedrooms above the first floor and three or four bedrooms on the lower ground level which are perfect for guests or additional staff accommodation. The wellness space on the lower ground level is perfectly though out with a swimming pool and sauna. The house is perfection for an avid art collector due to the high ceilings and abundance of wall space throughout. South Street is extremely well-located for a range of amenities and culture. The luxurious and world-renowned shopping streets of Bond Street and Savile Row are a five-minute walk from the property. With 24 hour police security around the house the house is incredibly secure. Even closer is the recently upgraded Grosvenor Square sporting the new Rosewood Hotel. A wide selection of London's finest restaurants, international music venues, leading museums, schools and universities are all within easy proximity making it a phenomenal address. The greenery of the 350-acre historic Hyde Park is at the end of South Street and yet Heathrow airport will soon be just 34 minutes away from Bond Street with the arrival of Crossrail. This rare house has been the of home of politicians and celebrities and was designed by two starchitects: Detmar Blow built the Edwardian mansion in 1902 while the modern-day wellness centre was designed by Nicholas Rakic. Boasting only three owners in its history one of which was acclaimed writer Dame Barbara Cartland this house can only be titled the epitome of luxury London living.NoticePlease note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.
